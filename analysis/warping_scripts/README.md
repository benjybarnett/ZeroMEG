# 3Dscanning

Scripts for collecting, analysing and using 3D scanning equipment in the lab. Currently we are set-up to use the Structure Sensor connected to an Ipad Pro.

## Things you can do:

### - Collect 3D scan using the Occipital Structure Sensor

### - [Process the 3D scan using Meshmixer](./process_mesh.md)

### - [Mark Fiducials, create headshape file & create coordinatesystem.json file](./mark_fiducials.m)

Important: Make sure your mesh is in the same space as your sensor positions!

### - Estimate a pseudo MRI using the [MEMES Toolbox](https://github.com/Macquarie-MEG-Research/MEMES)
